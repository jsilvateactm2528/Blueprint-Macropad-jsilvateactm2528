# Blueprint-Macropad-jsilvateactm2528
João Macropad is a 7 key macropad with 2 rotary encoders, an OLED Display. It also has 7 SK6812 MINI-E LEDs, and uses QMK firmware 

I spend a lot of hours on this build (I forgot to keep track of the time), because I'm new in this area and this is my first project. 
João Macropad is a compact macropad featuring 7 mechanical keys, 2 rotary encoders, a OLED display, and 7 rgb leds.

It was designed as a personal open-source hardware project.

## Features

7 mechanical keys (For macros)
2 EC11 rotary encoder with push button (One change volume and mute and the other rotate to move up or down a list of options on the OLED screen, and press to confirm a choice.)
4 pin 128x32 OLED display (At the moment, I don´t know for sure what options I will have in the display.)
5 SK6812 MINI-E LEDs (Just to illuminate the macropad.)
Seeed Studio XIAO microcontroller
QMK firmware
